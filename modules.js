//!MODULES
// A module is a piece of program
// that specifies which other pieces it relies on and which functionality it provides
// for other modules to use (its interface).

//!PACKAGES
// A package is a chunk of code that can be
// distributed (copied and installed). It may contain one or more modules and
// has information about which other packages it depends on. A package also
// usually comes with documentation explaining what it does so that people who
// didnâ€™t write it might still be able to use it.
